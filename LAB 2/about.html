            <p>Hiya! My name is Marta Negro.
<br>
                I'm sure the first thing you want to know are the names of my two dogs. 
                <br>
                Ikisi is the little one, adopted in Italy in 2012, and Teaspa was adopted in Thailand in 2020.
                <br>
                Thanks to the experience of adopting abroad, the idea of Help the dog fly was born. So, in my case, I can say that adopting a dog brought me more than happiness. 
                <br>
                I was born in Spain, but I've lived in many places. I currently live in Scotland. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a vet; I never made it, but I knew that my love for animals would find a way into my life. 
                <br>
                I want to help as many animals as possible, and to be honest, my biggest dream right now is to make this platform successful and make it my full-time job.
                <br>
